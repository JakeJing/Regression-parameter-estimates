# Regression parameter estimates
R code for parameter estimates in regression models with manual implementation of least squares, gradient descent and monte carlo methods for a simple toy example.

The code is for a linear regression problem with one single predictor (univariate regression) and includes least squares in closed form, gradient descent, Gibbs sampling and code in JAGS for the Monte Carlo methods.
